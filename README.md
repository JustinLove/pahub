# Planetary Annihilation Community Hub

This is the core platform of the Planetary Annihilation Community Hub.

## Installation

1. Download Atom Shell (tested with v0.16.1): https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases
2. Extract Atom Shell to a local folder
3. Download the zip archive of this repository: https://github.com/Raevn/pahub/archive/master.zip
4. Extract the `app` folder from the git archive into the resources folder of Atom Shell

Additional plugins are required to add functionality to the PA Hub. The following two plugins are considered 'core', and need to be installed:
* `com.pahub.content.plugin.contenthub`
* `com.pahub.content.plugin.store.plugin`

To install these, download the zip archives from their respective repositories, then unzip them into the following folder:
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Uber Entertainment\Planetary Annihilation\pahub\content\plugin\`

If you run PA Hub first, this folder will be automatically created.

## Usage

Currently only supports Windows.

To launch PA Hub, run atom.exe
